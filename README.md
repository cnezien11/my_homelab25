My homelab Setup (first time)

This repository documents my personal homelab environment — a hybrid setup for virtualization, Linux development, AWS cloud experimentation, and future networking projects.

             Overview: 

 This homelab is part of my hands-on learning as I pursue a Bachelor of Science in Cloud and Network Engineering – AWS Track. 

My homelab is designed to support: 
 Coming Soon....
- Virtualization & Infrastructure Testing via Proxmox VE
- AWS Cloud Projects using local compute resources. 
- Linux & Python Development on a dedicated Linux Mint machine
- Networking and security experiments on another device.
